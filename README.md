# NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER) FOR HEALTHCARE

This repository is My Master's thesis project for the Master's program in Data Science at the University of Bologna, focusing on Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the healthcare domain.
It includes the implementation of a NER model using the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically designed for healthcare-related text.

## Project Structure
- `dataset/`: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `papers/`: Contains relevant research papers and documentation related to the NER model and its application in healthcare.
- `src/`: Source code for the NER model, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts.
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies required for the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `LICENSE`: The license under which the project is distributed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- torch == 2.0.1
- other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```
